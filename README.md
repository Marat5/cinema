# Cinema

This project was created in educational purposes. I want to get more practice with backend and try new frontend framework.  
**WORK IN PROGRESS**  
At the end this will be a website that contains all the movies that I've seen along with their ratings

**/frontend** contains a svelte app that uses rest api provided by backend  
**/backend** contains a flask app
